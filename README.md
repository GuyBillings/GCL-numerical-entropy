GCL-numerical-entropy
=====================

C code implementing our GCL entropy computation in optimised form. Packaged as a mathematical function.

Also included is a C function for computing pattern separations (outsep)

These have been developed as external functions for Mathematica and hence should be compiled according to that procedure. 

These functions need to be compiled with the GMP and MPFR multi-precision C libraries.
